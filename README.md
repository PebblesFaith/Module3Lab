In Module 3, I have learned, how to use JavaScript language to work with content on webpages.  This includes modifying the content, attributes or style, modifying the DOM by adding and removing elements, and more.  This ability to work with webpages allows me to create interactive webpages.  In module 3, I will have an opportunity to use JavaScript language to manipulate DOM nodes and create users interactive experiences with my To-Do web application.
